# SmartWearableForCoalMineWorkers


Safety in the workplace is a critical concern, particularly in the coal mining industry, where potential hazards such as suffocation, gas poisoning, falling objects, ceiling collapse, and gas explosions are prevalent in underground mining. To address these challenges, cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart wearables have been explored to improve safety in mining. This report presents a wireless sensor network that enables real-time monitoring of conditions in underground mines from a central base station. The system includes temperature and hazardous gas sensors for continuous monitoring, as well as an emergency alert feature that notifies supervisors in case of incidents such as a miner falling down. Additionally, the report discusses the implementation of a Limit switch to detect if miners are wearing safety helmets or jackets. The use of smart wearables, such as safety helmets and jackets embedded with sensors, is highlighted for their potential to improve the safety and health of coal mine workers. Sensors such as temperature and humidity sensors, gas detectors, heart rate monitors, and GPS modules can enhance miner safety. The report emphasizes the need for further research and development in this field to develop effective risk mitigation and safety promotion strategies for the mining industry. By leveraging the possibilities of IoT and smart wearables, the mining industry has the potential to reduce accidents, health hazards, and improve overall miner safety and well-being.
